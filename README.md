# COMP206_A4
Image Processing using C, Python, and CTypes

This was Assignment #4 for COMP 206 - Introduction to Software Systems, taught by Professors Gregory Dudek and David Meger, at McGill University in the Fall 2015 semester.

This assignment was an exercise in using code profiling, working with preexisting libraries, and integrating C and Python through CTypes/Cython.

convolve_slow.py was provided and written by Professor David Meger. I do not own this code and did not write it.

convolve_fast.c and convolve_ctypes.py are my own code, and provide implementation of the matrix operations on the given input images.

I have also included the project description given by the Professor in the file comp206-assignment4-2015.pdf.
